## Development

### w/Local Web Integrations

If you would like to use this application to work on the [Mariana Integrations](https://github.com/Mariana-Tek/ember-mariana-integrations/) follow the instructions on the [web integrations](https://github.com/Mariana-Tek/ember-mariana-integrations/#running--development) to serve the project locally. Then instead of using the command `npx nf start -j Procfile.serve` use `npx nf start -j Procfile.serve.local`

We also support running the application with a local instance of the API. You can add these values to a local .env file in the root of the project.

```bash
MARIANA_ENDPOINT={tenant}
MARIANA_API_HOST={url to your local api}
```

### w/For Device Testing

If you would like to use this application to test on a device while serving the [Mariana Integrations](https://github.com/Mariana-Tek/ember-mariana-integrations/) locally. Then instead of using the command `npx nf start -j Procfile.serve` use `npx nf start -j Procfile.serve.ngrok`
